# Inndex - The Woodland Retreat Hotel

## Abstract:
[//]: <>
This project allows users to log into an account for a hotel in order to browse and book rooms. They have the ability to look through their previous reservations at our Woodland Retreat Hotel, and reserve a new room to return back to the embrace of our woodland respite!
  
## Installation Instructions:
[//]: <>
1. You will need two *separate* directories - one for the front end and one to emulate the back end / server:

1. 
Clone down the frontend repo found at: https://github.com/sdmisra/inndex \

Clone down the backend repo found at: https://github.com/turingschool-examples/overlook-api \

1. Install dependencies by using ‘npm install’ in your terminal within each directory. It is helpful in your terminal to create a second tab (with command + t on macs) in which to run the backend server.

1. To start backend server, within its directory run 'npm start'.

1. To host the front-end website on your local machine, run ’npm start’ in terminal.

1. Navigate to ‘http://localhost:8080/' in your browser.

## Testing Instructions:
[//]: <>

To run the test suite associated with the classes behind the scenes and how they interact: 
Run 'npm test' from the terminal while within the main directory of the application (inndex).


## Preview of App:
[//]: <>


If you encounter errors when trying to host the site with webpack: Remember to use ‘npm install’ before trying to host the server on your local machine!

## Learning Goals:
[//]: <>
1. Implement ES6 classes that communicate to each other as needed
1. Use object and array prototype methods to perform data manipulation
1. Create a user interface that is satisfying to engage with and clearly displays information
1. Write modular, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)
1. Implement a robust testing suite using TDD
1. Make network requests to retrieve and send data to API endpoints

## Future Feature Ideas:
[//]: <>
1. Develop manager tools within this application, for employee-side interactions with all of these same classes.
